# Problems/tasks given in at uni

All the solutions you see on this site is solutions to problems given at uni. 
I currently study electronics engineering and will probably bee doing a bit of
c/c++ in the future. Might be writing about it on my website if I find the time.

## Contribute

Feel free to contribute if you find any thing on which you'd improve. I'll look into it
might even pull it.

## Why

Good question, I just enjoy having everything neatly organized into one place so that I can 
pull it onto my different computers when I need to do so. 

## License

Act acording to the license.
